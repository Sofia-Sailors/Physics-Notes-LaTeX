# Physics!
This is a repo to manage and preserve my physics notes, all written in LaTeX.
Hopefully (at some point), I willfigure out emacs better and upload to/edit this repo directly from emacs or cli. until then, I'll be doing it manually through a GUI.

# "Packages"
I've included my raw .tex files along with compiled .pdf files. Also included in a reference pdf for basic latex commands.


# Usage
These notes are gathered from [OpenStax Physics 2e](https://openstax.org/details/books/college-physics-2e). While I am going to try my best to make decent links, It is important to study and think for yourself.
Just use this as a reference tool for some basic info or LaTeX formatting.
